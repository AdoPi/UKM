#Ubuntu Key Maker for Mac OS X
  It's a litte script to convert an iso file to img format.
  In addition my script ask you to enter the disk name of your usb stick and it will install in.
  At the end of the execution, you can eject your usb key and install ubuntu everywhere you want.

##How to execute?

  $chmod u+x ukmac
  $./ukmac path_to_your_ubuntu_iso
